# Advent of Code 2020

This repo contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), written in React+TypeScript.

This is the first time I participate in this kind of "contest" and I written these solutions in my spare time. I've
also taken the chance to start developing in React using hooks.

## Code structure

- One single file for each day with the solution: `src/days/DayX/DayX.tsx`

- Starting inputs (public example + personal assigned inputs) and interfaces if needed: `src/days/DayX/DayX.inputs.tsx`

## Test YOUR inputs

Since it has been developed in React, you can just start the project and change the inputs in the textarea with yours.

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

## The UI sucks!
I know.... UI will be improved once I have finished the 25 days path! I'll also focus on improve React code.  

## Contributing

I'm open to change my code if you found better solutions to the problems. A better solutions is one PR away :)
